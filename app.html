          <strong> COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. </strong>
          It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
         </p>
         <p class="color-blue"> 
          Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing 
          difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
          kidney failure and even death.
         </p>
         <p class="color-blue">
          Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and 
          nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing 
          symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. 
                Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone,

                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as 
                canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals 
                have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the 
                virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (

                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked 
                to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note 
                that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), 
                while other viruses are less so.

                 . Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends

                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. 
                Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing 
                or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general 
                food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going 
                to the bathroom.
               </p>
               <p>
                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on 
                it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main 
                way the virus spreads.
               </p>
               <p>
                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very 
                low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at 
                ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through 
                your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 
                and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or 
                stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
               </p>
               <p> 
                You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
               </p>
               <ul class="margin-left-39">
                <li class="margin-bottom-15"> 
                 Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 
                 <br>
                 <strong> Why? </strong>
                 Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
                </li> 
                <li class="margin-bottom-15">
                 Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.  
                 <br>
                 <strong> Why? </strong>
                 When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. 
                 If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the 
                 disease.
                </li> 
                <li class="margin-bottom-15">
                 Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. 
                 <br>
                 <strong> Why? </strong>
                 Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your
                 eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                </li> 
                <li class="margin-bottom-15">
                 Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your 
                 mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. 
                 <br>
                 <strong> Why? </strong>
                 Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as 
                 cold, flu and COVID-19.
                </li> 
                <li class="margin-bottom-15">
                 Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention 
                 and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. 
                 <br>
                 <strong> Why? </strong>
                 National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. 
                 Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. 
                 This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

                <li class="margin-bottom-15">
                 Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). 
                 If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or 
                 lung disease. 
                 <br>
                 <strong> Why? </strong>

                If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. 
                If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick,

                Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may 
                have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is 
                ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

                cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from 
                people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more

                 The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and 
                 pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin 
                 gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people 
                 (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who 
                 gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying 
                 medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious 
                 illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                 Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. 
                 Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or 
                 eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. 
                 Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                <p>
                 It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it 
                 and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way 
                 the virus spreads.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of 
                 spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, 
                 or frozen temperatures.

                 Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss

                From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and 
                humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting 
                COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this
                you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes,

                There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal

                To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted

                when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect 
                yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 
                Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal

               <p>
                However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes 
                between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.

                No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, 
                do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

               <p>
                The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine 
                against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
